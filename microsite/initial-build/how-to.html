            <p class="center">Both games in the Overwatch series are team-based hero shooters. Players select a hero character from a large roster (more than 40 by the start of 2025), divided among three class types. These are: Tanks, who have higher health and generally meant to help protect their teammates from damage, but are larger and easier to hit; Damage, who act as the team’s offensive leads; and Support, who heal, provide buffs for teammates, or de-buff the opposing team. Players are generally free to change to different heroes while inside their spawn room during the course of a match in response to the current tactics employed by other players.</p>

            <h3 class="header_heavy">QUICK PLAY MODES</h3>
            <div class="light_banner">
            		<ul class="modes">
                        <li>
                            <aside>
                                <p class="title">ESCORT</p>
                                <p class="mode">The attacking team is tasked with escorting a payload to a certain delivery point before time runs out, while the defending team must stop them. The payload vehicle moves along a fixed track when any player on the attacking team is close to it, increasing in speed if multiple attackers are present, but will stop if a defending player is nearby; should no attacker be near the vehicle, it will start to move backwards along the track. Passing specific checkpoints will extend the match time and prevent the payload from moving backwards from that point.</p>
                            </aside>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <aside>
                                <p class="title">HYBRID</p>
                                <p class="mode">The attacking team has to capture the payload (as if it were a target point from Assault) and escort it to its destination, while the defending team tries to hold them back.</p>
                            </aside>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <aside>
                                <p class="title">CONTROL</p>
                                <p class="mode">Each team tries to capture and maintain a common control point until their capture percentage reaches 100%. This game mode is played in a best-of-three format. Control maps are laid out in a symmetric fashion so no team has an intrinsic position advantage.</p>
                            </aside>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <aside>
                                <p class="title">PUSH</p>
                                <p class="mode">Each team attempts to secure control of a large robot that pushes one of two barriers to the opposing team’s side of the map, whilst being escorted by at least one team member, stopping when enemy players are nearby, similar to the payload movement system in Escort. The team that pushes the payload fully to the other side, or furthest into the enemy territory before the time runs out, wins the match.</p>
                            </aside>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <aside>
                                <p class="title">FLASHPOINT</p>
                                <p class="mode">Similar to Control, each team attempts to capture and maintain a common control point until their capture percentage reaches 100%. This game mode takes place on significantly larger maps with five separate control points, which take a shorter amount of time to capture as compared to a standard Control map. A central control point is always activated first; after it is secured by one team, the remaining four are activated in a random order. The first team to secure three control points wins.</p>
