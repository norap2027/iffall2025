                        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                        <p><strong>1</strong> large potato</p> 
                        <p><strong>1/2</strong> cup of vegetable oil</p>
                        <p><strong>2</strong> cups of white rice, cooked</p>
                        <p><strong>2</strong> steaks, tender meat, no fat or nerves (thin cut)</p> 
                        <p>Adobo seasoning with cumin</p> 
                        <p><strong>1/2</strong> cup of shredded bread</p> 
                        <p><strong>1</strong> cup diced tomatoes</p> 
                        <p><strong>1</strong> white onion, medium, diced thin</p> 
                        <p><strong>1</strong> tablespoon of chopped parsley</p> 
                        <p><strong>2</strong> eggs</p> 
                        <p>Cooking spray</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="column-two">
                    <h2>Directions</h2>
                        <p><strong>1.</strong> Wash the potato well and remove the skin with a potato peeler. Place it in a pot with enough water and add a pinch of salt. Boil for 20 minutes until it&apos;s cooked, but firm. Place in the refrigerator to cool while you prepare the rest.</p>
                        <p><strong>2.</strong> Cook the rice the way you would normally, what&apos;s important is to have two full cups once you&apos;ve finished cooking the rice. If you like, you can have it ready the day before.</p>
                        <p><strong>3.</strong> Season the steaks with the adobo. Place 1/4 of the cup of oil into a medium pan over medium heat. Pass the steaks through the crumbled bread and apply pressure to each side until completely covered evenly. When the oil is hot, cook for 1 1/2 minutes on each side or until the ends have browned. Be careful not to overcook the meat as the bread cooks quickly.</p>
                        <p><strong>4.</strong> When they&apos;re ready, set them on paper towels to remove the excess oil. Keep warm.</p>
                        <p><strong>5.</strong> Wash and dice the onions into small cubes and set aside. Open the can of tomatoes, strain and measure out 1 cup.</p>
                        <p><strong>6.</strong> Remove the potatoes from the refrigerator and chop into approximately 1/2 inch slices. Add the other 1/4 cup of oil to a non-stick pan and heat over medium-high. When the oil is hot, add the potatoes and fry for approximately 2 minutes on each side or until they&apos;ve browned. Place over paper towels to absorb the oil.</p>
                        <p><strong>7.</strong> While the potatoes fry, sprinkle cooking spray in a small pan and fry the eggs to your preference. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.</p>
                        <p><strong>8.</strong> Once the potatoes, rice, steaks and eggs are ready you can begin to put together the sillpancho.</p>
                        <p><strong>9.</strong> Place one cup of rice over a dish, then the steak and egg. Surround this by the tomatoes and onions on one side and the potatoes on the other. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and enjoy!</p>

                <h2>Recipe Websites</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://www.budgetbytes.com/">Budget Bytes</a> - I like this recipe website because everything is laid out very cleanly and it&apos;s immediately clear what the purpose of the website is. I think the tight margins also give your eye a clear path to navigate from.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/">New York Times Cooking</a> - I chose this website because the design is very minimalistic while still being engaging. I also love the images they use for their recipe&apos;s and how they do most of the design work on the page, as every other element takes a back seat to the photos.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://creme.com/">Creme</a> - I like this website becausee it feels very sleek while also being more playful than most recipe websites. It&apos;s also able to lay out a lot of content without being overwhelming which I really appreciate.</p>
                <h2>Non-Recipe Websites</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://ventriloc.ca/en/">ventriloc</a> - I chose this website because I reallyy enjoyed the monochrome color palette it employs. I also think the simplicity of the landing page is helpful for navigation, while the small animated details give visual interest.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.depo.studio/">Depo Studios</a> - I love the modular grid layout of this design and how it feels soft while still being sleek. I think it really aids the integration of both pictures and videos in a really artful way and could easiiy translate to a recipe website.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://tinywins.com/">TinyWins</a> - I really enjoyed the scale of the elements on the landing page. It draws your attention first to the brand and then to the website&apos;s navigation which I think is very smart. I also like the design touch of the circular mouse.</p>
