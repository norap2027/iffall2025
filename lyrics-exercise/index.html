            <h3>[Verse 1: PinkPantheress]</h3>
            <p>I left my room and I know I left too soon, it's over</p>
            <p>I wait for you</p>
            <p>I check my wrist</p>
            <p>Think my watch is tellin' lies on me</p>
            <p>I got here at six</p>
            <p>You won't explain why you aren't callin' me lately</p>
            <p>I'll wait outside all night because you want me to</p>

            <h3>[Pre-Chorus: PinkPantheress]</h3>
            <p>You're gettin' pissed</p>
            <p>I'll figure it out 'cause I know maybe one day you'll feel the same</p>

            <h3>[Chorus: PinkPantheress]</h3>
            <p>Woah, oh-oh, oh-oh (Get my mind off you)</p>
            <p>Where'd you go? (It was gettin' late)</p>
            <p>I'm goin' home</p>
            <p>I'll figure it out</p>
            <p>Maybe one day you'll feel the same</p>
            <p>Woah, oh-oh, oh-oh (Get my mind off you)</p>
            <p>Where'd you go? (It was gettin' late)</p>
            <p>I'm goin' home</p>
            <p>I'll figure it out</p>
            <p>Maybe one day you'll feel the same</p>

            <h3>[Post-Chorus: PinkPantheress]</h3>
            <p>I wish that I could snap my finger</p>
            <p>La-la-la-la-la</p>
            <p>Wish that I could, wish that I could</p>
            <p>La-la-la-la</p>
            <p>Wish that I could snap my finger</p>
            <p>La-la-la-la-la</p>
            <p>Wish that I could, wish that I could</p>
            <p>La-la-la-la</p>

            <h3>[Verse 2: PinkPantheress]</h3>

            <p>La-la-la-la-la</p>
            <p>I'm gettin' sick</p>
            <p>It's the feelin' I got when I saw the train that I missed (That I missed)</p>
            <p>La-la-la-la-la</p>
            <p>I got the next one 'cause you chose not to save me</p>
            <p>By drivin' me instead like I had asked you to</p>

            <h3>[Pre-Chorus: PinkPantheress]</h3>
            <p>You're gettin' pissed</p>
            <p>I'm hangin' around 'cause I know maybe one day you'll feel the same</p>
