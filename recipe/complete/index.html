                <h3>Directions</h3>
                      <p><strong>1.</strong> Wash the potato well and remove the skin with a potato peeler. Place it in a pot with enough water and add a pinch of salt. Boil for 20 minutes until it&apos;s cooked, but firm. Place in the refrigerator to cool while you prepare the rest.</p>
                        <p><strong>2.</strong> Cook the rice the way you would normally (pot or other method), what&apos;s important is to have two full cups once you&apos;ve finished cooking the rice. If you like, you can have it ready the day before.</p>
                        <p><img src="../complete/images/silpancho_steak.jpg" alt="steak image"><strong>3.</strong> Season the steaks with the adobo. Pass the steaks through the crumbled bread and apply pressure to each side until completely covered evenly. Place 1/4 of the cup of oil into a medium pan over medium heat. When the oil is hot, cook for 1 1/2 minutes on each side or until the ends have browned. Be careful not to overcook the meat as the bread cooks quickly.</p>
                        <p><strong>4.</strong> When they&apos;re ready, set them on paper towels to remove the excess oil. Keep warm.</p>
                        <p><img src="../complete/images/silpancho_salsa.jpg" alt="salsa image"><strong>5.</strong> To prepare the salsa, wash and dice the onions and tomatoes into small cubes and roughly chop parsley. Combine in a medium sized bowl and set aside.</p>
                        <p><img src="../complete/images/silpancho_potato.jpg" alt="sliced potatoes image"><strong>6.</strong> Remove the potatoes from the refrigerator and chop into approximately 1/2 inch slices. Add the other 1/4 cup of oil to a non-stick pan and heat over medium-high. When the oil is hot, add the potatoes and fry for approximately 2 minutes on each side or until they&apos;ve browned. Remove and set over paper towels to absorb the oil.</p>
                        <p><strong>7.</strong> While the potatoes fry, sprinkle cooking spray in a small pan and fry the eggs to your preference. Season with salt and pepper.</p>
                        <p><strong>8.</strong> Once the potatoes, rice, steaks, and eggs are ready you can begin to put together the silpancho.</p>
                        <p><strong>9.</strong> On a plate, place one cup of rice and arrange the potatoes off to the side. Then, atop of the rice, cover with the steak and egg. Place a healthy serving of salsa overtop the steak and egg, and enjoy!</p>
