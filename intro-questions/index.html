    <p>Nora Perry, Communication Design, Junior</p>
    <p><strong>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</strong></p>
    <p>I'm a ComDes major interested in design and I felt this course would be beneficial for gaining skills I need for future opporunities.</p>
    <p><strong>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</strong></p>
    <p>I took a coding class sophomore year of highschool, but I really don't remember much, I'd say im basically a beginner.</p>
    <p><strong>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</strong></p>
    <p>Gaining a good understanding of the basics of coding, especially as it applies to design.</p>
    <p><strong>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</strong></p>
    <p>It requires far more typing and testing.</p>
    <p><strong>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</strong></p>
    <p>https://www.pinterest.com/ - I think Pinterest has done such a good job at optimizing their userface to look so sleek and organized while
    still having a very organic feel, to me it is a great example of web design.</p>
    <p><strong>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</strong></p>
    <p>https://peoplesgdarchive.org - I think this is a great example of communication because everything is laid out in a very understandable 
    way which makes it easy to nagivate. The images are also laid out in an engaging way while still being easily viewed.</p>
    <p><strong>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice</strong></p>
    <p>https://www.last.fm/ - This website is super easy to nagivate while giving a lot of data and statistics that are easy to digest. It also
        has a nice layout and style and I feel like its hard to do both.</p>
